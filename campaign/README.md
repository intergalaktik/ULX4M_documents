## ULX4M-LS - Lattice ECP5 FPGA - CM4 IO comaptible SOM

Embedded systems are everywhere, including in trusted environments. 
But what is really inside them? 

ULX4M is a modular version of the popular open hardware project ULX3S. 

ULX3S FPGA development board is designed and manufactured in Croatia as a result of cooperation between the Radiona.org makerspace, the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computing (FER), University of Zagreb and Končar-INEM. 

The ULX3S board was designed by Radiona’s member Davor Jadrijević in response to the need for a compact, robust and affordable development FPGA platform equipped with a balanced range of built-in additional components and expansion ports, while fully covering the needs of the “Digital Logic” course at FER. 

Following the successful Crowd Supply campaign, Intergalaktik d.o.o. took over the further production and distribution of ULX3S boards.

After noticing ULX3S and other opensource FPGA boards impact NLnet decided to fund developement of modular version that will help other projects to easily integrate FPGA into there designs.

ULX4M delivers a versatile programmable (FPGA) modular mainboard that can be used a wide choice of peripherals. 

With ULX4M we have decided to go with CM4 IO compatible pinout that gives us posibility of using many great CM4 IO compatible boards.

As the community continues to grow, lots of FPGA modules are written, and one goal of our boards would be that we can easily switch and check other vendor chips, and work more on vendor neutral code where possible.

We are specially interested in adding fast SerDes peripherals that are now missing on ULX3S.

Also big interest goes to DSI (Display Serial Interface) and CSI (Camera Serial Interface) as most of the CM4 IO boards has them available.

ULX4M-LS is first in the series of CM4 compatible IO boards

Current board periferal

    LFE5UM-85F-8BG381C

    Onboard 128M-bit FLASH

    Onboard 64Mb SDRAM

    All CM4 IO GPIOs

    2 Buttons

    4 LEDs

    SD card connection - shared with HAT pins

    2 lane MIPI CSI camera port CAM0 and CAM1

    2 lane MIPI DSI display port DISP0 (fake differential)

    SerDes pair connected to second DSI connector DISP1

    SerDes pair (TX/RX) connected to 2.0 header (radio experiments)

    SerDes connected to PCIe 1x

    2x SerDes pairs connected over capacitors to connector

    True differential GPDI video output

    Fake differential GPDI video output

    1Gb ethernet (still under consideration)

With an open source design, users are not dependent on anyone to make boards and can run independent production.

Open Source

ULX4M is completely open source, all files are available on github repository https://github.com/intergalaktik/ulx4m

ULX4M project is funded by NLnet and from the begining we are trying to log our work.
You can check our blog posts about work we have done so far.

On the same blog you can check how Paula is exploring world of 3D and with combination of KiCad and Blender creating Photo-Relistic board animation.
