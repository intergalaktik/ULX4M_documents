# ULX4M
Modular FPGA board

- [ ] Create few simple boards with different type of connectors
- [ ] Board will have powersupply and few leds
- [ ] Order boards
- [ ] Study FPGA pinout and the way we can connect ECP5
- [ ] Have some pictures/animation of boards snapping together
- [ ] Assembly Board and test connections
- [ ] Start to work on first doughter board that will have selected connectors
- [ ] Order board
- [ ] Have some pictures/animation of boards snapping together
- [ ] Assembly
- [ ] Board should slip into connector and blink some leds
- [ ] Starting to work on mainboard
- [ ] Add all ULX3S perifers to the board, and leave placeholders for new periferal
- [ ] User opinions, considering/fullfilling wishlists, beautification
- [ ] Blender animation
- [ ] Study other FPGA vendors
- [ ] Main board assembly
- [ ] Write verilog examples
- [ ] Test all onboard periferal
- [ ] Adding periferals to the board
- [ ] Ordering
- [ ] Start to work on some other vendor doughter board
- [ ] Do some blender animation with main board and different vendors
- [ ] Assembly main board
