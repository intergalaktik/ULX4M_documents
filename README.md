- [x] Board will have powersupply and few leds -- changed to HDMI connector
- [x] Order boards
- [x] Study FPGA pinout and the way we can connect ECP5
- [x] Have some pictures/animation of boards snapping together
- [x] Assembly Board and test connections
- [x] Start to work on module board that will have selected connectors
- [x] Order board
- [x] Have some pictures/animation of boards snapping together
- [x] Assembly
- [x] Board should slip into connector and blink some leds
- [ ] Starting to work on mainboard
- [x] Add all ULX3S perifers to the board, and leave placeholders for new periferal
- [x] User opinions, considering/fullfilling wishlists, beautification
- [x] Blender animation
- [ ] Study other FPGA vendors
- [x] Main board assembly
- [x] Write verilog examples
- [x] Test all onboard periferal
